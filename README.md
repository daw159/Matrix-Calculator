💡 Matrix Calculator in C++
A feature-rich Matrix Calculator built using C++ fundamentals. This project allows users to perform a variety of matrix operations with a clean text-based interface and color-enhanced display for better user experience.

🚀 Features
This program supports the following matrix operations:

1️⃣ Matrix Addition
➕ Adds two matrices of the same dimensions element-wise.

2️⃣ Matrix Subtraction
➖ Subtracts one matrix from another (same dimensions).

3️⃣ Scalar Multiplication
✴️ Multiplies every element of the matrix by a scalar value k.

4️⃣ Matrix Multiplication
✖️ Multiplies two compatible matrices using the standard dot-product rule.

5️⃣ Matrix Transpose
🔁 Flips the matrix over its diagonal (rows become columns and vice versa).

6️⃣ Matrix Power
📈 Raises a square matrix to a positive integer power using repeated multiplication.

7️⃣ Trace of a Matrix
🧮 Calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix.

8️⃣ Determinant of a Matrix
📐 Computes the determinant of any square matrix using Gaussian elimination.

9️⃣ Inverse of a 2x2 Matrix
🔄 Calculates the inverse of a 2x2 matrix using the standard formula.

🔟 Exit
🚪 Allows the user to gracefully exit the calculator.

💾 File Logging
All results are saved to result.txt using the following helper functions:

save() – Appends the resulting matrix to a text file.

logOperation() – Logs the name and details of the operation performed.# Matrix-Calculator
